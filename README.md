# EXOR - Web-based Express Restaurant Ordering App

From Author: 
I build this project not only wanted to challenge myself for building a real-world web-app also a chance to practicing my VueJS Skills.

So the design of this app will not be pretty (not an arts student), but I will try to make it EASY to USE.

## Current Progess: In Development

02/08/2018:
I uploaded the initial build, only Login interface is finished, right now the app can connect to Google Firebase for storing data and User Authentication.... basic stuff.

Having trouble to hosting it via Firebase.... will update more once solved.



## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
